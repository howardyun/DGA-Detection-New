# Bilbo the "Bagging" Model

We created a novel hybrid neural network, Bilbo the “bagging” model, that analyses domains and scores the likelihood they are generated by such algorithms and therefore are potentially malicious. Bilbo is the first parallel usage of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for DGA detection.
