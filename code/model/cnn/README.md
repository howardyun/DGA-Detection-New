# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 

This CNN architecture adapted from [Vosoughi, et al.](https://lsm.media.mit.edu/papers/tweet2vec_vvr.pdf) and based on code from [Yu, et al.](http://faculty.washington.edu/mdecock/papers/byu2018a.pdf)

![CNN Model Arch Diagram](CNN_Arch.png)

Using the following initialised variables:

```
max_features = 38
input_shape = MAX_STRING_LENGTH
net = {}
```

Python 3.7
